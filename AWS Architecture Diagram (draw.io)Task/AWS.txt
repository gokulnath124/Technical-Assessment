This architecture uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the public subnet to distribute high traffic loads across an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances placed in private subnets for security. The multi-tier VPC design separates public and private layers, improving isolation and scalability. A managed RDS/Aurora database provides a highly available and fault-tolerant data layer, while ElastiCache (Redis) accelerates performance by caching frequent queries. Security Groups and Network ACLs secure traffic flow at both instance and subnet levels. CloudWatch and centralized logging deliver complete observability for monitoring, scaling triggers, and troubleshooting. Route 53 handles DNS routing, ensuring low-latency global access.
